# MISSION SUMMARY

To help re-establish communications with the team on Mars, you must accomplish the goals outlined below. We respect your expertise or we wouldn't have called you here today, but to help ensure you are up to speed, each task will start with a tutorial to help you come up to speed with the technology quickly, and then end with the mission specific goals.  You will be working in teams.  While there is glory for the teams that help repair communications first, the mission isn't complete until all teams succeed so be willing to help if you see a team struggling!

Mission control has established the following three goals.

[Establish IoT Hub Communications](IoTHubs)

[Verify staff using Cognitive Services](CognitiveServices)
